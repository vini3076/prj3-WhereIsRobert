## Features
The project follows the MERN (Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application) for a structured repository:
- client/: Contain the public and source.
- source/: Static assets (CSS, images, etc.).
- server/: Contain the config, models, schemas and utils.
- config/: connection.js.
- models/: Campground, index and User.js
 
Environment Variables - Sensitive information, including API keys and database credentials, are stored as environment variables for security. 
We set up the files in the root directory with the following variables:
- DB_HOST=your-database-host
- DB_USER=your-database-username
- DB_PASS=your-database-password
- SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret 

## Test
Go to Where's Robbert? page (Heroku deployment page)
Create a User Accout
