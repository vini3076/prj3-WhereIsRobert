The project follows the MERN (Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application) for a structured repository:
- client/: Contain the public and source.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN that I have an internet signal in my current nomadic location,
WHEN I visit www.whereisrobbert.com, THEN I find a search input box and options to sign up or log in;
WHEN I click on Sign up, THEN I am invited to enter my username, email, and password;
WHEN I click on Login, THEN I am invited to enter my username and password;
WHEN I enter a park name into the search bar, THEN the app responds by providing a list of cards representing campgrounds in or near the park searched;
WHEN I look at the cards, 
THEN I see that the cards display the name of the campground, an image, a URL, a description of the campground, a reservations page link, and the first listed fee for that campground.
WHEN I am also logged into the app, THEN I will also find a button for Save Campground on each campground card.
